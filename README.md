# Disclaimer
Create a chatbot to assist users in asking queries about college admissions, programmes, application procedures, qualifications, and scholarships. To produce responses and be able to recognise user inquiries about various admission themes, the chatbot should employ the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The trick is getting the chatbot to understand user questions and respond in a clear and useful way while merging its responses with accurate and pertinent information from the college admissions office.
